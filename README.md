# BigBoxInterview

This is my interview response for BigBoxVR. I have two branches here:

master - Branch that represents what existed when the interview time finished. Had some issues connecting to Azure PostgreSQL through the default firewall configured by Azure. Unfortunately wasted a lot of my time.
PostgresWorking - Branch that contains working Postgres code. Figured out the firewall issue in Azure portal immediately after submission and so I took 30 min to implement a PostgreSQL solution to meet one of the stretch goals.

I recognize that the PostgresWorking branch will not count as a submission for this interview but I thought I'd include it in case you would like to take a look!

Thanks and appreciate the time.
